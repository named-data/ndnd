NDNd is a Golang implementation of the Named Data Networking (NDN) [protocol](https://named-data.net) stack.

See the project [overview](https://named-data.net/project/), architecture [details](https://named-data.net/project/archoverview/) and the [tutorial](https://101.named-data.net/) for more info on NDN.

## üèóÔ∏è Installation

Pre-built static binaries for all supported platforms are available on the [releases](https://github.com/named-data/ndnd/releases) page.

NDNd is written in pure Go and requires [Go 1.23](https://go.dev/doc/install) or later to build from source.
Once Go is installed, run `make` to build the `ndnd` executable, followed by `make install` to install it globally.

# üåü Usage

NDNd provides several independent modules that can be used separately or together.

You can use the `ndnd` CLI to list available modules and get more info on their usage.

Named Data Networking Daemon (ndnd)

Usage: ndnd [command]
  fw              NDN Forwarding Daemon
  dv              NDN Distance Vector Routing Daemon

  ping            Send Interests to an NDN ping server
  pingserver      Start an NDN ping server under a prefix
  cat             Retrieve data under a prefix
  put             Publish data under a prefix
```

## üîÄ Network Forwarder

The `ndnd/fw` package implements YaNFD, a packet forwarder for the NDN platform.
It is compatible with the management tools and protocols developed for the [NFD](https://github.com/named-data/NFD) forwarder.

To start the forwarder locally, run the following:

```bash
ndnd fw run yanfd.config.yml
```

A full configuration example can be found in [fw/yanfd.sample.yml](fw/yanfd.sample.yml).
Note that the default configuration may require root privileges to bind to multicast interfaces.

Once started, you can use the [Forwarder Control](tools/nfdc/README.md) tool to manage faces and routes.

## üì° Distance Vector Router

The `ndnd/dv` package implements `ndn-dv`, an NDN Distance Vector routing daemon.

To start the routing daemon bound to the local forwarder, run the following:

```bash
ndnd dv run dv.config.yml
```

A full configuration example can be found in [dv/dv.sample.yml](dv/dv.sample.yml).
Make sure the network and router name are correctly configured and the forwarder is running.

Once started, you can use the [DV Control](tools/dvc/README.md) tool to create and destroy neighbor links.

## üìö Standard Library

The `ndnd/std` package implements `go-ndn`, a standard library for NDN applications.

You can use this package to build your own NDN applications.
Several examples are provided in the [std/examples](std/examples) directory.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools

The `ndnd/tools` package provides basic utilities for NDN networks.
These can be used directly using the `ndnd` CLI.

- `ping`/`pingserver`: test reachability between two NDN nodes
- `cat`/`put`: segmented file transfer between a consumer and a producer
